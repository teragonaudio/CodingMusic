What is CodingMusic?
====================

CodingMusic is designed to make good background noise for programming. Each
track lasts for roughly 30 minutes of intense concentration, with a slow
buildup towards gradually more energy. After each 30 minute sprint, one should
take a short break to get up, stretch, walk around, etc. The music itself is
open-source, and pull requests are accepted, assuming they fall within the
same spirit as these tracks.


How is it designed?
===================

What makes CodingMusic different than just listening to techno or a DJ mix? It
has been composed with a number of specific considerations in mind:

- The music itself is very simple, without any distractions. It's very
  repetitive, to the point of being meditative.
- The tracks are sequenced in a way to gradually build energy. At the 15
  minute mark, the track takes a slight increase in energy. Towards the 25 and
  28 minute marks, the energy is the highest. At the 29 minute mark, the
  energy drops (usually goes just to drums) to indicate the timer has nearly
  run out.
- Each track has been produced and mastered with headphones (not usually the
  norm in music production). They are meant to sound best with a good pair of
  headphones, not a club soundsystem.
- During mastering, extra equalization has been added to boost frequencies
  around the range of the human voice. This helps to drown out office noise
  and distracting conversations.
